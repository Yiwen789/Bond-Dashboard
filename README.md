# Bond-Dashboard

This project creates a set of two dashboards that help facilitate bond trading with Python. **pm.py** helps porfolio manager 
make requests based on ideal characteristics of the bonds. **webapp.py** helps traders search through qualified bonds by 
connecting available bond market information and bond issuer credit ratings. 

**pm.py** allows portfolio manager to make entry of bonds one at a time and export them in a batch. **webapp.py** 
allows users to break down portfolio manager comments from **pm.py**. IMGR1.xlsx is a sample portfolio manager comments 
that could be used by **webapp.py**. 

**pm.py** and **webapp.py** are made interactive through Dash, an Open Source Python library for creating reactive, 
Web-based applications.
